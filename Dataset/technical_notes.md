## üìä KPI Calculations ‚Äì Overview Dashboard

Total Bookings  
Total Bookings = COUNT('Trip Details'[Trip ID])  
Counts all completed trip records.

Total Booking Amount  
Total Booking Amount = SUM('Trip Details'[fare_amount]) + SUM('Trip Details'[Surge Fee])  
Calculates total trip revenue including surge pricing.

Average Booking Amount  
Avg Booking Amount = DIVIDE('Trip Details'[Total Booking Amount], [Total Bookings], BLANK())  
Calculates average revenue per trip with safe divide.

Total Trip Distance  
Total Trip Distance =  
VAR TotalMiles = SUM('Trip Details'[trip_distance]) / 1000  
RETURN FORMAT(TotalMiles, "0") & "K miles"  
Sums all trip distances and formats the result in thousands of miles.

Average Trip Distance  
Avg Trip Distance =  
VAR AvgMiles = ROUND(AVERAGE('Trip Details'[trip_distance]), 0)  
RETURN AvgMiles & " miles"  
Rounds the average distance to nearest whole number with unit formatting.

Average Trip Time  
Avg Trip Time =  
VAR AvgTime = AVERAGEX('Trip Details', DATEDIFF('Trip Details'[Pickup Time], 'Trip Details'[Drop Off Time], MINUTE))  
RETURN FORMAT(AvgTime, "0") & " min"  
Calculates the average trip duration using DATEDIFF.

## üìç Location Analysis Measures

Farthest Trip  
Farthest Trip =  
VAR MaxDistance = MAX('Trip Details'[trip_distance])  
VAR PickupLocation = LOOKUPVALUE('Location Table'[Location], 'Location Table'[LocationID], CALCULATE(SELECTEDVALUE('Trip Details'[PULocationID]), 'Trip Details'[trip_distance] = MaxDistance))  
VAR DropoffLocation = LOOKUPVALUE('Location Table'[Location], 'Location Table'[LocationID], CALCULATE(SELECTEDVALUE('Trip Details'[DOLocationID]), 'Trip Details'[trip_distance] = MaxDistance))  
RETURN "Pickup: " & PickupLocation & " ‚Üí Drop-off: " & DropoffLocation & " (" & FORMAT(MaxDistance, "0.0") & " miles)"  
Finds the trip with the longest distance and formats a descriptive string.

Most Frequent Pickup Point  
Most Frequent Pickup Point =  
VAR PickPoint = TOPN(1, SUMMARIZE('Trip Details', 'Location Table'[Location], "Pickup Point", COUNT('Trip Details'[Trip ID])), [Pickup Point], DESC)  
RETURN CONCATENATEX(PickPoint, 'Location Table'[Location], ", ")  
Returns the pickup location that appears most often.

Most Frequent Drop-off Point  
Most Frequent Dropoff Point =  
VAR DropOffCounts = ADDCOLUMNS(SUMMARIZE('Trip Details', 'Location Table'[Location]), "DropOffCount", CALCULATE(COUNT('Trip Details'[Trip ID]), USERELATIONSHIP('Trip Details'[DOLocationID], 'Location Table'[LocationID])))  
VAR RankedDropoffs = ADDCOLUMNS(DropOffCounts, "Rank", RANKX(DropOffCounts, [DropOffCount], , DESC, DENSE))  
VAR TopDropoff = FILTER(RankedDropoffs, [Rank] = 1)  
RETURN CONCATENATEX(TopDropoff, 'Location Table'[Location], ", ")  
Calculates most common drop-off using an inactive relationship.

## ‚è∞ Time-Based Calculations

Pickup Date  
Pickup Date = DATE(YEAR('Trip Details'[Pickup Time]), MONTH('Trip Details'[Pickup Time]), DAY('Trip Details'[Pickup Time]))  
Extracts only the date part for daily trend analysis.

Pickup Hour  
Pickup Hour = HOUR('Trip Details'[Pickup Time])  
Returns the hour portion (0‚Äì23) for hourly distribution visuals.

## üîó Data Model Structure

Fact Table: Trip Details  
Dimension Table: Location Table

Relationships:  
- Pickup Location: One-to-many ‚Äî Location Table[LocationID] ‚Üí Trip Details[PULocationID]  
- Drop-off Location: Inactive relationship ‚Äî Location Table[LocationID] ‚Üí Trip Details[DOLocationID] (activated using USERELATIONSHIP in DAX)
